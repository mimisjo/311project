<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  We examined the amount of time it took for the city to respond to service requests
to see if there were differences in how quickly services were closed across Chicago's 
50 wards. We also looked at estimates of the mean household income for each ward to see 
if there was a difference in response times between wards that corresponded with income
levels.
